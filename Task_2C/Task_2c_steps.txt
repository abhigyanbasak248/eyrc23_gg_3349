Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1.  First to extract the 5 regions of interest, we worked with the Sameple.png to find out their coordinates.
2. We converted the image to HSV and used a colour trackbar created using openCV to detect the min and max values of BGR for creating a mask with inRange function on the image.
3. Once the mask was created we did a Canny edge detection and subsequently a contour detection on the Canny image.
4. We ran a loop for each contour detected and set a threshold value of the area of the contour found through trial and error.
5. After getting an appropriate threshold, we get the x and y coordinates of the top left corner and the width and height of the contours of the 5 regions of interest in the image.
6. Using the x,y,w,h values we extract the part of the image and feed it to the classify function.
7. For the classification function we used a pretrained ResNet101 model with Adam optimizer, learning rate 0.01 and crossentropy loss. We froze all the layers and changed the number of output neurons to 5 and also added the softmax activation function.
